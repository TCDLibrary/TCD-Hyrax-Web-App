Mayo, 1815-1853) to her husband, John William Alexander D’Alton (of Bessville, Co. Meath, 1792-1867).

Tom is really an extraordinary being they are just on civil terms with him here but no cordiality between them I am I must own glad when I think that anything will make my own come down to me my fond tomorrow three weeks we parted from each other -and indeed they are the longest three weeks I ever pas[sed] dear dear own do come if you can at all and make your own happy with the sight of her own loved fond –Tom I believe wrote to you yesterday &amp; there is some demur about D’Alton taking the sub agency but as for the former he is an inconsistent creature and I would not mind what he says half a minute and D’Alton would I dare say get security &amp; if you were here yourself –I am glad Magan has written to you about the quit rent as I think the longer the right of it remains undecided the more difficult it will be to settle it &amp; as to your letter from Val Irwin I fancy you will find it very hard to execute his mothers commission for they are without exception the most disagreeable untaught boys exclusive of the science of epicurism I ever met with –you know she has a bad tongue herself when she is vexed yet you would be perhaps surprised at the degree of spite with which she speaks of the O Ferrals the cause of which I hear is some trifling inattention to Master John I am not a little surprised at your visit from Mr and Mrs Thom which was rather forward of her and ignorant of him I spoke to Tom about the rent roll &amp;c &amp;c more than once he says he has it ready to send you the first opportunity and that you may be sure will be as soon as I can get the wild fowl for you but the Grouse shooting does not begin until the 26th of this month and nobody is allowed to shoot until then how I wish I was to eat them with my poor own You ask how my uncle Myles and I met, he came to Mass here yesterday week (Sunday) We bowed slightly en passant but had no [ms damaged] communication during the day nor has he been [ms damaged] since My dear old own how it frets me you should be so lonely and sad I believe indeed as you say you feel like an orphan without me but my old own I hope will soon be with me again and who shall then part us Ah! Own dear I dont know how I ever consented to this journey without you I hope you take care of yourself my darling and that you don’t forget eating Stirabout –now and then I was reading Buchan’s domestic medicine here the other day in which it was strongly recommended also a simple Electuary which I copied and will make for my own when I go home to him and I know he will take when it is made by his poor owns old paw. I am glad to hear Betty stays quiet, but with respect to Williams bed cloathes I think it very odd she should not miss the blanket sooner you have dated that part of your letter Monday the day fortnight after I left home and I believe you discharged William either that day or the next she must at all events be very careless of her business if she left the bed so long without making it tell her so and also that she must air it once a week either in the Garden or at the Kitchen fire &amp; turn it every day tell her also if I hear of anything she has missed I shall consider her accountable for it as she does not mention it in proper time. I certainly did not put up the blanket -, so my poor old own has not been able to bespeak his black cloathes, now my darling dont neglect getting them the first money you get my poor fond thinks of himself last of any one but indeed he ought to be taken the most care of the poor own old Darling –Monday you nasty old fond I sent yesterday to the post office in hopes there would have been a letter there for me but there was none my own I long to hear from him how does your Mother get on I was dreaming of her all night but do not tell her so –We breakfast as late as usual here it is now near eleven o Clock and none of them down yet Charles McDermott and his cousin Miss Shiel of Ballyshannon rode over here to breakfast yesterday and spent the day she is a nice merry little Girl but has grown up very plain tho’ one of the prettiest Children I ever saw Charles is as great an original as ever and gave us a long romantic history of an adventure as he called it but which was nothing more than meeting a talkative old woman in a bog this he lengthens out with fine words and sentences for nearly two hours -and ended it with saying that it was a pity such brilliant parts and in fine such a woman should be buried in a Cabin –You are much mistaken if you expect to get any books from him, he is more choice of them than ever his father was –he lent some old Magazines here the cover of one of them was torn off (a blue paper one) and he was as fretted about it as you or fusty would be at loosing some valuable Black letter Manuscript –We had also Mr Joseph McDonnell here yesterday and his Nephew little Jones of Banada a very nice little boy Billy and he were very great but Eliza was quite frightened at Mr McDonnell and would not stay in the room at all she is such a pet with Anne that I am afraid she will spoil her she is beginning to make almost as great a noise about her when she leaves the room as she did after Celo and sleeps with her every night Mr McDonnell intends returning to Boulonge Sur Mer immediately and I think a certain friend of ours would have no very strong objection to accompany him if he could but this is only a conjecture of my own –for he does not speak of it even if he could –he set off last night to a supper at Dough Castle in a heavy rain, you would laugh if you heard old Dennis who was a little tipsy advising him not to go, and that he ought to be more consequential of himself -Miss Shiel did not go home last night but Charles did and is to return for her to day I shall send this letter to the Office by them as they return I was reading Rob Roy these two or three days do you recollect Celia Fitzgerald lent it to you some days after we were married and old own and I tried to read it in the study but I did not half attend to it I was so happy with poor bold but now that he is far away from me it amuses me very much there are some beautiful passages in it do you recollect particularly the night that Rob Roy passes in the highlands with Francis Osbaldist on and the account he gives of himself to him particularly when a thought of the future destinies of his sons flashes across his mind Walter Scott is certainly a very clever man yet after all he writes very carelessly sometimes –Have you heard anything from Baldwin since I last wrote to you? surely if he persists in his objection to anonymous publications you will have no objection to puting your your name after that Reble Lord of yours dont be cast down I hope he will yet be successful as he undertakes his present Campaign under your guidance he will fight with more skill than he did in former times -[ms damaged] you seen Mrs Bellew yet and what do you think of Maria O Kelly I hope Mrs Reynolds’s will not provide for her as quick as it did for Miss Brennan I am (thank God) quite well of my cough and want nothing to make me as happy as I am well but my own dear fond this is a sad dull county and I have no news to tell you but that Catherine o Connor is to be married this day to a Mr M-and are to set off after the ceremony for Dublin on their way to France Mr Cooke the priest who dined here yesterday was talking of the old Castle of Roscommon, I was thinking of your hero, and the Goodly company you had assembled within its walls –dear old own I think of you or of something concerning you every minute and always –This is such a wet day I fear I will get no one to take this letter to the Office but indeed it is now always raining in these mountains –dear Darling own come to me if you can I did my best to make what you wrote about be settled here but I suppose Tom wrote to you why it was not settled don’t be vexed with his folly whatever he has written Monday 9th August 1824 Tuesday I could get no one to go to the office yesterday as Tom is going there and tells me you may get it tomorrow if he is there before the mail goes off my own darling adieu ...but come if you can dear dear own adieu Billy &amp; Eliza send you Kisses and also their orders to come to them as well as your poor old troublesome Kate.</Abstract><Bibliography>A Bibliography Value</Bibliography><CALM>Calm ref</CALM><CatNo>MS2327-64</CatNo><Citation>IE TCD MS 2327/64</Citation><CopyrightNotice>Copyright 2017 The Board of Trinity College Dublin.
